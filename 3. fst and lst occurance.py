- search in sorted array -> manei binary search



## prolem is 1st and last index of target

- 1st index -> obiously the most efficient way to find one is bst
- lst index -> bst from the other side ??

## cheat
- as the array is sorted all the similar numbers should be one after another
- can't we just iterate until we find mitchmatch

'''
notmal binary search can't guranty the pos of 1st occurance
as the mid point might be any occurrence of the target, not necessarily the first one.
it only confirms eithget the target exists or not

'''
the smallest index that is >= target
important to NOTICE:
-> smallest
-> greatr or equal

## to ensure smallest
- we will the return imidiately after finding a match 
- we will store that pos as `ans` and try to minimise as long as we can
- when we will reach our boundery we will return the `ans` variable

## here
- for this problem we will ignore `greater` 
- and will only look for `exact` match
